## Why Exhibition Cargo Requires Specialized Logistics

Unlike standard freight, exhibition cargo involves unique challenges:

- Fixed delivery and dismantling schedules  
- Temporary imports and customs regulations  
- High-value, fragile, or custom-built displays  
- Precise coordination with event venues and organizers  

Every minute matters. Every detail counts.

This is where experience makes the difference.
